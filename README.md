## 1. Introduction 


This code is designed to predict the IMDB scores of movies using a machine learning model. It uses a dataset of movie features to train the model and make predictions on new data. 


## 2. Prerequisites 


Before you can run the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed: 


- Python (version 3.6 or higher) 

- pip (Python package manager) 


## 3. Dependencies 


To run the code, you need to install the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. You can install them using pip: 

  

```bash 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

``` 

  

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of the required packages and their versions. 

  
## 4. Getting Started 


Clone this repository to your local machine: 

  

```bash 

git clone https://github.com/Karthikeyan232004/ADS_Phase1.git 

``` 

  

Change your current working directory to the project folder: 

  

```bash 

cd imdb-score-prediction 

``` 

  

## 5. Running the Code 


You can run the code by executing the main script: 

  

```bash 

python imdb_score_prediction.py 

``` 

  

This will train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the performance. The results will be displayed on the console. 
  

## 6. Data 
  

The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository. You will need to provide your own dataset in CSV format. Ensure that your dataset contains the following columns: 


1.Title of the film 

2.Genre of the film 

3.Original premiere date 

4.Runtime in minutes 

5.IMDB scores 

6.Languages currently available 

 

### Data source: ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores )


## 7. Model 

  
The code uses a pre-defined machine learning model for IMDB score prediction. You can find the details of the model in the `model.py` file. 

  
## 8. Evaluation 

  
The code provides metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. You can find the evaluation results in the console output after running the code. 
  

## 9. Customization 

  
You can customize the code and the machine learning model to fit your specific needs. You can modify the model architecture in `model.py`, or you can fine-tune hyperparameters in `imdb_score_prediction.py`. Additionally, you can use different datasets to train and test the model.
